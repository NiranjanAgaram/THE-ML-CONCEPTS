ðŸ’¡ What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning hyperparameter?

â€¢ A model parameter describes the final model itself, e.g. slope or intercept in a simple linear regression model.
â€¢ A learning hyperparameter describes the way in which a model parameter is learned, e.g. learning rate, penalty terms, number of features to include in a weak predictor, etc

So, you can think of it like this:

- The learning hyperparameters are the settings that you specificy when you want to train a model.

- The model parameters are the rules that mathematically describe the final model that makes your predictions.
